HOW TO USE THESE FILES
1) Upload the folder's contents to GitHub (create a repo, add index.html, enable GitHub Pages) OR
   upload index.html directly on Netlify (drag & drop) OR place index.html in your hosting public_html.
2) Edit the register link in index.html to your preferred signup/form URL.
3) To add analytics or forms, edit index.html to include your Google Analytics or form action.

If you want me to:
- create a signup form (Google Forms / Mailchimp) and add it to this page
- add WhatsApp chat button or countdown timer
- host this on GitHub and provide the live URL
